The flow to use for evaluation:


Dear Ismail,

I hope this email finds you well. First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere appreciation for your dedication and hard work in organizing the event. I am reaching out to discuss an important matter regarding the TCL scripts that were previously shared.

It has come to our attention that the IO locations specified in the previous TCL scripts, i.e., merge.vivado.tcl and merge_pnr.tcl, were designed specifically for "Design_181" and are not applicable to other designs. Unfortunately, we have encountered difficulties in deriving the IO location variables for the "place_cell" from the given design.pl file. In light of this, we would like to propose an alternative approach to address this issue:

1. For each design, we suggest using the patched Vivado with macroplacement.pl. This will allow us to export the IO location variables from the placement result.

2. Within each Design folder, we will create a new script named "place_io.tcl." This script will be dedicated to placing the IO elements.

3. We will provide a script that converts the macroplacement.pl file generated by the participants into a specialized TCL script for placing DSP and BRAM components.

4. By utilizing the TCL scripts mentioned in steps 2 and 3, we can proceed with the Vivado placement flow for LUT & FF placement.

If you find this approach acceptable, we are more than willing to assist you in developing these scripts for the participants' use. Our team has expertise in this area and can ensure the smooth execution of the proposed solution.

Please let us know your thoughts on this matter and whether you would like us to proceed with the development of the mentioned scripts. We are committed to providing the best possible support to make this event a success.

Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to your response.

Best wishes,
    Jing Mai
