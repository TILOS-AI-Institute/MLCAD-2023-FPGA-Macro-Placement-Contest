1. Map fixed IO block coordinates to device coordinates:  Navigate to the directory that contains the benchmark suite.  Please copy and compile the "io_map.cxx" script using the following command:
```bash
g++ io_map.cxx -o io_map
```

3. Run create_io_map.sh:  This script iterate through the directories named "Design_*" and performs the following steps:
```bash
for dir in ./Design_*/;
do
    \cp io_map $dir;
    \cp io_map.csv $dir;
    cd $dir;
    ./io_map >& place_io.tcl
    \rm io_map;
    \rm io_map.csv;
    cd ..;
done
```
By following these steps, the "io_map" executable and "io_map.csv" file will be copied into each "Design_*" directory. The script will then be executed, generating the "place_io.tcl" file as output. Finally, the "io_map" and "io_map.csv" files will be removed from each directory.

4. To generate your solution run "macroplacement_bookshelf2vivado.py."  This python script converts the "macroplacement.pl" file generated by participants into a TCL script named "place_macro.tcl."
   To run this script, navigate to the "Design" directory and execute the following command:
```bash
python macroplacement_bookshelf2vivado.py
```

5. To evaluate your solution, run "vivado_pnr.tcl" script, which utilizes Vivado's native placer for placement. To run this tcl script, do the following command within the "Design" directory:
```bash
vivado -mode tcl -source vivado_pnr.tcl
```
