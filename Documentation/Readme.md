  Thank you for your and team's participation in the 2023 MLCAD FPGA macro placement contest.  The first tasks you need to do are the following:

  1.  Obtain a Vivado license: 
 Please ask your advising professor to submit a Vivado license request from the Xilinx University Program (XP), https://www.xilinx.com/support/university/donation-program.html as outlined in  https://github.com/TILOS-AI-Institute/MLCAD-2023-FPGA-Macro-Placement-Contest/blob/main/Contest-Registration/Registration.
  2. Download and install Vivado and test  installation:
After your team obtains a Vivado license from XUP, please follow the instructions outlined in  https://github.com/TILOS-AI-Institute/MLCAD-2023-FPGA-Macro-Placement-Contest/blob/main/Documentation/Vivado_Install-and-Flow_Evaluation_Instructions.pdf to download and install Vivado 2021.1 excutable and the MLCAD 2023 contest patch.
Download the benchmark suite dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ismailbustany/mlcad-2023-fpga-macro-placement-contest-dataset)
Test your installation by running the Vivado place-and-route flow TCL file, place_rounte.tcl, in the  Design_1 benchmark directory.
   3. Read contest documentation:  
Please read the documentation for the contest provided on the github site,  https://github.com/TILOS-AI-Institute/MLCAD-2023-FPGA-Macro-Placement-Contest/tree/main/Documentation.
